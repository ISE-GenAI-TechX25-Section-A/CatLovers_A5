* Participant introduction: Introduce yourself and your team, give the participant a brief overview of their role in the user study and the persona they will be playing while interacting with the application. 
   * Ensure they understand to speak aloud often to explain their thoughts, actions, and intentions before performing an action.
* Tasks: Provide users with a scenario in which they want to perform a given task. 
   * Ask users to let you know when they think a task is complete. 
   * Be sure that the wording of your task does not use keywords that might point them at how to complete it.
      * For example, use language like “You want to download WhatsApp” as opposed to “Install WhatsApp using the App Store” since both “App Store” and “Install” are things they might view on the screen.
* Notes: Take notes of where a user is confused, hesitant, or misunderstanding the experience. These are areas you may want to fix later.
* Feedback: After the participant indicates their task is complete, ask them for feedback.
   * How easy/hard was it to complete the task given? 
   * What confusions were there? Why were they confused? 
   * What could be improved?
* Results: After the test, list out the issues/challenges that participants had, hypothesize the reason for each, and list your chosen remedy to improve it. 
   * Include participant quotes in your explanation of the problem.
