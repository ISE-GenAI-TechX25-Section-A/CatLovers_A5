Results:
* Challenges: Users struggled to understand how their selections impacted progress, and found the layout unclear. It wasn’t obvious that selecting a workout would contribute to Buff Cat Points, and dropdown options weren’t clearly connected to the goal setting sections.
* Hypothesis: These issues likely stem from weak visual feedback and a lack of clear layout structure. Key components (like dropdowns or workout impacts) were not visually connected, and some users weren’t sure what their interactions were achieving.
   * Participant stated: “I clicked a workout but wasn’t sure if it did anything... does it count towards my cat points?”
* Fixes:
   * Fix #1: Add a visual confirmation (e.g., highlight, animation, or color change) when a workout is selected
   * Connect each selection to Buff Cat Points visually with a small pop-up — “+5 cat points earned!”
   * Fix #2: Reorganize goal options (daily, weekly, monthly) into clearly labeled tabs
   * Add tooltips or hint text next to buttons like “Add Work” or “Make Daily Goals” so users understand their purpose instantly
