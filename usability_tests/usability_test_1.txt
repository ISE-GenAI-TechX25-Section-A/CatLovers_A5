Notes:
* 1)
   * Tried to check the workouts already shown like a checklist. 
* 2) 
   * Tried to add a goal under the make daily goals in order to add the workout because they couldn't find the drop-down/button. 
* 3)
   * No problems
* 4)
   * Tried to click on the weekly goal progress bar
   * Said there should be the button underneath the weekly goals
   * It's too small writing
   * No problems after finding the drop down


Feedback:
* How easy/hard was it to complete the task given? 
   * Super easy. 8/10
* What confusions were there? Why were they confused? 
   * Couldn't find the buttons. Was lost are started clicking randomly because couldn't find the buttons. 
* What could be improved?
   * Bigger writing. 


Results:
* Challenges: The main challenges were not being able to find the drop down menus relevant to the task.
* Hypothesis: This is probably due to a confusing layout (button off to the side instead of near when it’s referring to, not clear which things are clickable) and small, unnoticeable writing. 
   * Participant stated, “there were a bunch of things that looked like buttons but weren’t and I was lost”
* Fixes: 
   * Moving the drop downs to be near what they are related to and increase the size (of the button and the text)
   * Change the workouts completed and goals sections to look less like a clickable checklist
